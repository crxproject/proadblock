## Description

Advertising displayed on webpages can be a security risk. Currently, the advertising consists of embedded third party content. These contents are not under the website's owner editorial control and add a repeatedly criminally exploited attack vector to the website. An adblocker protects a user's surfing. This plugin supports the usage of advertisement blockers and shows a warning message to users that have no adblocker enabled.

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nowherecoding/pro-adblock/releases/latest) and extract the archive, then copy the extracted folder to your WordPress plugins directory, either by uploading it via FTP or by using the "Add Plugin" function of WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page.
3. If you want: Open the plugin configuration page, which is located under Settings -> Pro-AdBlock and customize settings like displayed text, font color and background color.
